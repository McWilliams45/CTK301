<h2> Growing up </h2>
	<p> I was originally born in Weatherford, Texas and lived near there til i was about four years old! My dad got moved to Wilmington, Illinois for his job which caused us to move down here and since then I have been living there and spent most of my life growing up. Before we even moved out of texas, We had a old home computer at my house and my mom always said I used to go on the computer all the time and play around. When I was growing up in Wilmington, I would always be on the computer, playing games like Club Penguin or watching videos on YouTube, and just messing around and looking at all the settings and stuff on the computer. Doing all that made me learn all the things about computer on my own and other techy stuff like, how to connect different stuff and what the wifi or resolution stuff are, etc. If anyone in my family ever needed help with their computer, I would always help them and solve the problem. This basically aided with my interest in the technlogy field. </p>

<p> Around 8 or 9 years old, i found a new obsession which was vdieo games. Specifically, Call Of Duty. I ended up playing all the time with friends and by myself and made amazing memories since then. I even made 2 best friends through it. this inspired to me to have a future career in game developemnt or so soemthing in the gaming industry.</p>

<h3> where i am now </h3>
I am currently going to school at Illinois State University with a major in Game Design, currently thinking about minoring in Film.
