<h2> Growing up </h2>
	<p> I was originally born in Weatherford, Texas and lived near there til i was about four years old! my dad got moved to Wilmington, Illinois for his job which caused us to move down here and since then I have been living there and spent most of my life growing up. Before we even moved out of texas, We had a old home computer at my house and my mom always said I used to go on the computer all the time and play around. When I was growing up in Wilmington, I would always be on the computer, playing games like Club Penguin or watching videos on YouTube, and just messing around and looking at all the settings and stuff on the computer. Doing all that made me learn all the things about computer on my own and other techy stuff like, how to connect different stuff and what the wifi or resolutuon stuff are, etc. If anyone in my family ever needed help with their computer, I would always help them and solve the problem. This basically aided with my interest in the computer/technlogy field, I have always been a tech savy person since a young age. I basically grew up with technology. Then when i was like 8 or 9, I played on my brother's playstation for the first time and played the game "Call of Duty: Black Ops". Since then, I got an hooked on playing video games and it quickly became a major part of my life. </p>
